        Rust has three types for representing a
        sequence of values in memory:

        1. Array Type
        2. Vector Type
        3. Slices Type

        1. Array Type: [T; N] represent an array of N values,
           each of the type T.
           It is not growable and you can't append new elements
           or shrink it.

        2. Vector Type: Vec<T> represent a vector of Ts.
           It is a dynamically allocated, growable sequence of
           values of type T.
